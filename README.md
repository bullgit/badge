# Badge

A second version of the bullgit badge ([v1 by @lukyvj](https://github.com/bullgit/bullgit-badges)), by [@haroenv](https://github.com/haroenv).

# Usage

just like you would include any script, include this in your html

```html
<script src="/path/to/badge.js"></script>
```

You can for example use the [rawgit]() cdn like this:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bullgit/badge@master/badge.js"></script>
```

# License

WTFPL, do use this!
